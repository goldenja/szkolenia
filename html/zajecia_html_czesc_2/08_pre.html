    <h1>Pre <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> </h1>

    <pre>
      Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest; 
      Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,
      And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;
      Such profit he by envy could obtain.
    </pre>
    
    <pre>
      A head where wisdom mysteries did frame,
      Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
      As on a stithy where that some work of fame
      Was daily wrought, to turn to Britain's gain.
    </pre>
    
    <pre>
      A visage stern and mild, where both did grow,
      Vice to contemn, in virtue to rejoice;
      Amid great storms, whom grace assured so
      To live upright and smile at fortune's choice.
    </pre>
